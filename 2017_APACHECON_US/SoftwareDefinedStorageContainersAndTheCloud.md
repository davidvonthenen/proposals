Developer Advocate  

David vonThenen is a Developer Advocate at {code} by Dell EMC. The {code} team lives and breathes Open Source by making contributions to the community in a wide variety of projects ranging from Apache Mesos, Docker, and storage orchestration platforms. Prior to joining {code} by Dell EMC, David was a technical architect and development lead for a Backup/Recovery solution with heavy focus in the virtualization space, VMware in particular.

**Brief Description (A tag line that will be used on schedules, or as a subheading to your title. (up to 255 characters):**  
Skynet is upon us! And it exists in the Cloud!

**Short Abstract:**  
Persistent applications can be complex to manage and operate at scale, but tend to be perfect for modern schedulers such as Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, and etc. Internal direct attached storage and external storage are both options to run your applications. This talk outlines how 2 Layer Scheduling and Software Defined Storage enables deployment of managed frameworks and tasks, while maintaining high availability, scale-out growth, and automation.

**Long Abstract:**  
Persistent applications can be complex to manage and operate at scale, but tend to be perfect for modern schedulers such as Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, and etc. The current trend in Containers is taking their ephemeral nature and turning it upside-down by running databases, NoSQL, wordpress, and etc within them. Internal direct attached storage and external storage are both options in running your long running, persistent applications. The problem is how do you run these applications and containers in production environments?

This talk outlines how 2 Layer Scheduling, as known as the Offer-Accept model, and Software Defined Storage enables deployment of managed frameworks and tasks, while maintaining high availability, scale-out growth, and automation. This combination of technology will help build a "skynet" like architecture for persistent application and containers in the cloud.

**Message to the Reviewers:**  
The audience will learn about a critical principle concepts in container schedulers. Many container schedulers already have 2 Layer Scheduling present in their Ecosystem while other container schedulers have the feature as prior number one in their roadmaps. 2 Layer Scheduling will fundamentally change the way we consume container runtimes, like Docker, Rocket, and etc.

This presentation will discuss the concept of Software Defined Storage (SDS) and how its deployments into cloud environments like Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Amazon AWS will compliment container schedulers. Those not familiar with Software Defined Storage will also be given a high level introduction to the benefits of the technology.
