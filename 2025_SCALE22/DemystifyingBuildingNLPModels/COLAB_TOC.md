# Workshop Using Google Colab

Welcome to landing page for workshop `Demystifying Building Natural Language Processing ML Models and How to Leverage Them By Example` at `2025 SCaLE 22x`.

## Prerequisites

Using the Google Colab Notebooks or Kaggle Notebooks in this workshop is pretty straight forward, but you will need to setup the following **FREE** accounts for services we will be using in this workshop.

### Google Colab

As long as you have a Google account, you should have no problem accessing [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) OR [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/). If you don't have a Google account, please create one.

### Free SaaS Platforms Accounts Required

For the last third of the lab, we are going to make use of the following SaaS platforms:

- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) - This is to help facilitate building an Voice-Activated AI Assistant/Agent.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) - This is to provide an LLM in the examples.

#### Deepgram Account

You need a Deepgram account in order to do the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech. The account is free and you get $200 in credits! [Sign up at Deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com)

Set the API Key to the following environment variable: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`.

#### OpenAI Account

You need a OpenAI API Key to use an LLM to provide responses in the Voice Assistant. [Sign up at OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

Set the API Key to the following environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
