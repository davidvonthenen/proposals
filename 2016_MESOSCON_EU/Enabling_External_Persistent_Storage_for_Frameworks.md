Since being unveiled at MesosCon Europe in 2015, external persistent volumes have quickly received a lot of attention with its potential applications. We will discuss using volume drivers as means of provisioning external storage for Mesos Frameworks. We will specifically use the Elastic Search framework (https://github.com/mesos/elasticsearch) as a reference implementation to discuss how the solution of adding external volumes was architected. A demo of the Elastic Search framework will be provided with discussions about how external storage can benefit Frameworks and the applications they manage.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. We realize that this can be a difficult question to answer, but as with the abstract, the relevance of your presentation is just as important as the content.:**  
This discussion will help developers understand some of the challenges and solutions that were encountered when enabling external storage for Frameworks, provide insight for potential enhancement requests for Mesos, and expand the Mesos user base understanding of Mesos Frameworks.

**Technical Requirements. List any technical requirements that you have for your presentation over and above the standard projector, screen and wireless Internet.:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS.
