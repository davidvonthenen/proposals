**Abstract. Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal. This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).:**  
One problem of running Enterprise Applications in Mesos has been making applications and their data highly available. To date, utilizing local disks on Mesos Agent nodes has given us data persistence, but unfortunately does solve the data mobility problem required to make applications tolerate Agent node failures.

We will discuss what Software Defined Storage (SDS) is, how Software Defined Storage can transform local storage into an external globally accessible pool, how Mesos clusters can overcome this data mobility problem, and more importantly do so in such a way that is simple and easy to consume via a Mesos Framework. Will have a demonstration of Mesos Framework that will deploy a scale out software defined storage platform and deploy applications leveraging this new type of storage.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. We realize that this can be a difficult question to answer, but as with the abstract, the relevance of your presentation is just as important as the content.:**  
This session will introduce the concepts of Software Defined Storage to users who might not be familiar with the subject, give guidance in running Enterprise Applications in Mesos clusters, and review Mesos Frameworks which is driving the enablement of storage platform.

**Technical Requirements. List any technical requirements that you have for your presentation over and above the standard projector, screen and wireless Internet.:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS.
