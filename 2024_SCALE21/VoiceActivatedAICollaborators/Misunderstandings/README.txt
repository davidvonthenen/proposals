Requirements:
I used Deepgram's summarization capabilities which is reflected in the functionality of the script, but you can you anything you would like and you should get similar results.
You can sign up for a free account at: https://deepgram.com


Steps to run summarization:
1. [recommended but not required] Create a Python Environment using something like Conda
2. set your DEEPGRAM_API_KEY as an environment variable
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. copy one of the transcription files from ./transcription to the same level as the script main.py and rename to conversation.txt
5. run the script: python main.py
