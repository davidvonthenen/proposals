**Brief Description:**  
Unleash Voice and Conversation Understanding in IoT & Edge: A Practical Guide with LLMs

**Short Abstract:**  
Discover the power of voice-assisted IoT and Edge interfaces in this practical session. Learn to create effective voice-activated devices, using LLMs like ChatGPT and PaLM 2. Gain insights into design decisions, essential components, and collaborative frameworks.

**Long Description:**  
In the fast-evolving landscape of IoT, Edge, and On-Premise Devices, voice-assisted interfaces are becoming increasingly crucial for seamless user interactions. This session aims to give attendees a hands-on introduction to creating voice-assisted interfaces in these environments. We will delve deep into the requirements for a voice-assisted device and how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or PaLM 2 to empower these devices to process and understand the context of conversations. This isn't about high-level generalities; it's a practical how-to guide with an emphasis on live demonstrations.

Key Highlights:
1. On-Premise vs. Hosted LLMs: We'll explore the critical design decisions in choosing between on-premise and hosted LLMs for IoT and Edge devices, giving you the insights needed to make the right decisions for your specific use cases.
2. Components for Success: Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the essential components required to build effective voice-assisted interfaces. We'll cover everything from voice recognition to natural language understanding and response generation.
3. Creating a Collaborative Framework: Learn how to build a collaborative framework that allows IoT and Edge devices to complete tasks with the assistance of voice-driven AI. We'll provide practical examples and hands-on demonstrations to illustrate the concepts.

By the end of this session, attendees will be empowered to consider their unique use cases and will have a solid starting point for designing and implementing their voice-driven AI collaborator, enabling them to bring a new level of interactivity and efficiency to their IoT, Edge, or On-Premise Devices. Don't miss this opportunity to unlock the potential of voice-assisted interfaces in your projects and applications.

**Message to the reviewers:**  
Voice interfaces are among the most accessible and intuitive ways to interact with devices and systems, making technology truly inclusive. Our session is designed to showcase the power of voice in IoT and Edge, providing hands-on live demos and practical code examples. Attendees will leave with the tools to create their own IoT and Edge devices, unlocking a world of possibilities.
