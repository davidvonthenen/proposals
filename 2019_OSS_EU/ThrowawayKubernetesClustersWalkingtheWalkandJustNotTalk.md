**Title:**  
Throwaway Kubernetes Clusters: Walking the Walk and Just Not Talk

**Abstract:**  
We have been talking about treating Kubernetes clusters as disposable for some time now. There are multiple efforts within the community to make that dream a reality with projects like Cluster API and kubeadm.

The real problem isn't walking away from a cluster (that's easy), but rather it's realizing what to do about the hundreds or even thousands of applications running within that cluster. That's the truly difficult aspect of treating clusters as throwaway.

What makes those applications indispensable?
- application data (databases, metrics, etc)
- configuration (certificates, accessibility, etc)
- transaction logs
- audit logs for regulatory compliance

In this session, we will cover:
- migrating applications and their data between clusters
- discuss embedding these methodologies into existing community efforts
- enhancing projects like ClusterAPI to leverage these concepts

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
We have been talking about treating Kubernetes clusters like cattle for quite some time, but the reality is we are still very far away from that dream. This talk will discuss going past the headlines and taglines of treating clusters like cattle by examining all the various things needed and produced by applications that make swapping out the clusters underneath them so difficult.

What do to about...
- application data and logs
- stateful applications using persistent volumes
- how monolithic applications complicate migration
- certificate management

This talk will focus on a top-down view of treating clusters as disposal. As users we don't care about the infrastructure underneath, we care about our applications and things required for them to run without problems.

**Technical Requirements:**  
Standard equipment will do fine
