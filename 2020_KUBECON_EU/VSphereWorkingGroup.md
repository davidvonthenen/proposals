**Session Description:**  
Cloud Providers and CSI drivers have reached the mainstream Kubernetes community. Members within the community are deploying persistent stateful applications on Kubernetes clusters both in the cloud and on-premises in production environments.

A lot of the design and planning effort architecting these deployments has been through a significant amount of trial and error and painful iteration. The discussion in this session will address various deployment strategies on VMware infrastructure to make your clusters run smoothly, efficiently and more importantly... stress-free.

Some topics that will be discussed:
- Brief vSphere subproject updates and housekeeping
- Cloud Provider (CPI) and CSI driver basics
- Discuss multi-tenancy and role-based access introduced in CPI v1.1.0
- Deployment recommendations/strategies for large and multi-tenant environments

These topics will be discussed via an interactive/live demo to help encourage and support discussion with attendees.
