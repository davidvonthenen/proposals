**Title:**  
How To Develop and Consume Kubernetes External Cloud Providers: A Look Toward The Future

**Abstract:**  
Kubernetes cloud provider functionality has been deeply integrated within its code base for some time now. That is soon about to change in upcoming releases as the in-tree cloud provider functionality is deprecated and externalized. How can this functionality be built out as external components? How can we consume these components in this new view of the world?

This session will provide a blueprint to Kubernetes cloud provider developers to create cloud-specific providers, Cloud Controller Managers and Container Storage Interface drivers, and prepare administrators to consume these components within their clusters. Will be walking through functionality that exists within the Kubernetes code base and how these externalized components are implemented using interfaces defined within the community.

**Audience:**  
The audience should be familiar with Kubernetes and some of its basic operational aspects. We will touch upon subjects involving how to modify settings that exist within Kubernetes to enable consumption of cloud functionality via their providers. Knowledge of deploying Kubernetes by at least one method (via tools, automation, etc) would be preferred but not required.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
Will outline how to develop Kubernetes cloud provider components and discuss how administrators can consume these cloud-based components. Will provide a walkthrough in the form of a demo to capture the key concepts and highlights of this talk.

**Have you given this presentation before?**  
No

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS, GCP, or cloud provided infrastructure.
