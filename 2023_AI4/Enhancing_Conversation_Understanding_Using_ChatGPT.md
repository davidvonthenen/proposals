**Proposed Topic:**  
The world has shifted and embraced working remotely. In the post-COVID era, it’s estimated that 27% of US workers are doing so remotely. That’s roughly about one in four people. In this environment, people still need to interact and collaborate with colleagues, customers, and potential clients, most of whom use digital conference platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

This talk focuses on using Conversation and Generative AI to enhance discussions and extract meaningful insights from those digital conversations. We will discuss foundational information relating to both topics, uncover how we can apply them to digital communications, and finally demonstrate what capabilities you can unlock by integrating these platforms.
