**Abstract Title:**  
Using Helm and Charts for Security Conscious Users

**Abstract:**  
Container registries have made life easy and with the advent of Helm, consuming applications and services have truly simplified managing the lifecycle of containers in Kubernetes. For those workloads or companies where security means everything, pulling container images from public registries are a nonstarter. Because what could possibly go wrong blindly trusting the internet?

This session will discuss options available to secure container images including using a private container registry. We will look at the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed methods for consuming images. A live demo that will include standing up a private registry and how to manage its container images will be provided.

**Audience:**  
The audience will learn about the Helm architecture, understand how to navigate the Helm command line interface, get acquainted with the various components of a Helm chart (aka the blueprint for an application deployment), use the advanced functionality that Helm provides to override configuration options on a given Helm chart, and how to deploy a private container registry.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will help users devise a plan for securing their container images so they can be consumed in a safe and effective manner. Attendees will be able to duplicate the live demo for use as a starting point for implementation in their own Kubernetes infrastructure and learn how to use Helm to pull images from that private registry.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
