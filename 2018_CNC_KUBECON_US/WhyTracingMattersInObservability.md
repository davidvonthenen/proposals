**Track:**  
Jaeger

**Type of Submission:**  
Session Presentation

**Audience:**  
Intermediate

**Topic:**  
Observability

**Abstract Title:**  
Why Tracing Matters In Observability

**Long Abstract:**  
Imagine that you are in a dark room unable to see who is in the room with you. Then imagine trying to have a conversation with these anonymous people to achieve some kind of objective. Things get interesting when one of the people turns out to be a bad actor intent on misdirecting the group. That's exactly what could happen when an instance of a microservice decides to go off the rails and starts to misbehave.

What happens when these services stop working or worse yet when they are running but running slowly? Which service instance is the culprit? This session will discuss key concepts of tracing and how you can leverage Jaeger in order to get better visibility into the distributed nature of a microservice architecture. A live demo using Jaeger in a Kubernetes environment will be used to highlight the benefits of tracing for observability.

**Audience:**  
The audience should be familiar with the basics of Kubernetes. This session will enable users to think about an observability strategy when it comes to deploying microservices in a containerized infrastructure like Kubernetes. This talk will provide a blueprint to enable applications to use tracing tools like Jaeger.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss key concepts of tracing and benefits that Jaeger bring to the table. Will provide a live demo of Jaeger using an example set of interdependent microservices and trace those services for debugging and troubleshooting. Attendees will be able to duplicate the live demo for use as a starting point for implementation in their own microservices.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
