**Proposal for ContainerSched London 2017**  

**Title of Talk**  
Robust Applications for Container Schedulers by using External Storage  

**Submission Type**  
45 Minute Talk  

**Abstract:**  
Containers are starting to reach the masses and people are using them in ways other than what was originally intended. We now find persistent applications like SQL and NoSQL databases being run in container schedulers, but how to we guarantee data availability for production applications in the wake of compute node failures? There are options for using direct attached or external storage, but the devils in the details, as choices in storage types have significant repercussions.

We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using direct attached or external storage and how that impacts applications running in production environments. The trade-offs of each decision have interesting consequences starting from initial deployment to "day 2" operations and even how these applications tolerate system failures.
