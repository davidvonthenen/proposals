**Abstract Title**  
How Mesos Can Help With Your Divorce

**Abstract. Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal. This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).:**  
Breaking up with your software stack is never easy. In the best case, it's a 1-to-1 swap and you retrain people. Yea right! The worst case can get far scarier. In the meantime, the software stack you chose is starting to show signs of aging and being abandoned with issues and bugs starting to pile up. What do you do?

There are many benefits to Container Schedulers like Mesos. One such benefit is they provide an abstraction layer between your applications and underlying infrastructure and how it's being managed. There are articles of companies or resources fleeing from technologies all the time with the latest example being Intel cutting funding to its OpenStack effort in a recent article by Fortune. This session will focus on how Mesos can make it easy for your organization to get a divorce from the underlying software managing your infrastructure.

**Audience. Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.:**  
The audience will learn about how they can architect a strategy that not only facilitates their organization to easily replace their underlying infrastructure implementation but also enables a path towards consuming containerized workloads. Will discuss options for moving traditional applications into containers and a process for migrating those applications toward a microservice architecture.

**Experience Level. (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any):**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. This could be for Linux, open source, open cloud, embedded, etc.:**  
Technologies come and go. Some fast than others. This discussion provides decision makers, architects, and operations a blueprint towards modernization of their core business. Since the talk focuses on abstraction layers, the options for what your organization infrastructure and provisioning process remain open based on your needs; whether the best decision is to move on-prem in a datacenter or into the cloud using services like AWS or GCE.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS or with remote infrastructure.
