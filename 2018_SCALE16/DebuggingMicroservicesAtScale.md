**Short Abstract:**  
This presentation will be a live demo using Prometheus and Jaeger to debug various scenarios one might encounter in a production deploy of Microservices. We will quickly cover Prometheus and Jaeger and the benefits they provide and then promptly move into the demo. The demo will cover how we can identify potential problems in a Kubernetes cluster by artificially creating issues in the container orchestrator, networking, and deployed Microservices. Audience participation is encouraged to discuss potential root causes for the issues discovered.

**Long Abstract:**  
This presentation will be a live demo using Prometheus and Jaeger to debug various scenarios one might encounter in a production deploy of Microservices. We will quickly cover Prometheus and Jaeger and the benefits they provide and then promptly move into the demo. The demo will cover how we can identify potential problems in a Kubernetes cluster by artificially creating issues in the container orchestrator, networking, and deployed Microservices. Audience participation is encouraged to discuss potential root causes for the issues discovered.

Audience participation will be highly encouraged as we will discuss how the various identified problems can translate into things we can check within the environment to resolve the issue. The audience will become familiar with the Prometheus and Jaeger web interfaces and how to navigate various features that they provide.
