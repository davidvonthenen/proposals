**Abstract Title:**  
Application Monitoring and Tracing in Kubernetes: Avoiding Microservice Hell!

**Long Abstract:**  
Creating and deploying microservices is easy. The real problem is how to manage and support these services out in the wild and in production. What happens when these services stop working or worse yet when they are running but running slowly? Which service instance is the culprit? This session talks about how you can leverage metrics and tracing tools in order to give better visibility into the distributed nature of a microservice architecture in a Kubernetes environment.

This presentation will discuss key concepts of metrics and tracing and highlight Open Source Projects available that address: 1) the value of instrumentation and how Prometheus can be used to monitor and measure a Kubernetes cluster, and 2) how Jaeger can provide visibility into your applications and microservices.

Will provide a demo of Microservices leveraging Prometheus and Jaeger deployed to Kubernetes cluster.

**Audience:**  
The audience should be familiar with the basics of Kubernetes. this session will enable users to think about a monitoring strategy when it comes to deploying microservices in a containerized infrastructure like Kubernetes. This talk will provide a blueprint to enable applications to use metrics and tracing tools like Prometheus and Jaeger.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss key metrics and tracing concepts and benefits that Prometheus and Jaeger bring to the table. Will provide a live demo of deploying Jaeger using Helm and using an example set of interdependent microservices, we will trace those services for debugging and troubleshooting. Attendees will be able to duplicate and use the demo as a starting point for implementation in their own microservices.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
