Title:  
Go'ing Towards Containers

Talk Format:  
Tutorial (45mins)

Abstract:  
This tutorial covers how Go can kick-start your organization's containerization strategy by discussing the benefits of using Go with Docker, demonstrating the ease of developing with and creating Docker images for your Go apps, and how that strategy ties into the larger ecosystem.

Audience Level:  
All

Description:  
Containers aren't new. There is has been an incredible amount of buzz and interest surrounding them, BUT the tides are turning as 2016 marked an important year in a significant uptick in real production deploys. This tutorial will talk about a path from a Go perspective to get your hands dirty with containers both for evaluation and heading towards production.

Outline:
1. Intro  
  * Stats for container use  
2. Containers 101  
  * Benefits  
  * Docker  
3. Review Go Strengths  
4. Best of Both Worlds  
  * Synergy!  
5. Demo  
  * Go Development Env  
    - Spin it up quickly!  
    - Simple application in seconds!  
    - Linux platform  
    - Windows platform  
  * Working with your existing Go IDE  
    - Importing and Exporting your Go Source  
  * Building  your Go app
    - Reproducible Build Env  
    - More complex application (REST API)  
    - Dockerfile introduction  
    - Create Docker image
    - Migrating to a newer version of Go. Simple!  
  * Test  
    - Deploy our application  
    - Let's test our application!  
  * Publishing  
    - To Docker Hub  
    - Continuous Integration  
  * End-Users  
    - How end-users deploy?  
    - Same!  
6. Wrap up  
  * Dev/Test methodology is Production  
  * Outlined a possible application lifecycle  
  * Micro-services!  
    - Forward Looking: Container Schedulers  

In conclusion, this session outlines a possible software development and publishing strategy, but more importantly, it offers an easy to consume guide for Go users to quickly pick up containers both for Dev/Test while also looking the full application lifecycle. This provides a great introduction and conversation starter in how containers can be adopted and adapted within your organization.

Notes:  
This talk requires a previous use of Go (that shouldn't be a problem since we are all at GopherCon). No container experience is required as the talk is geared towards boot-strapping Go developers to using containers quickly. For those that want to follow along in the tutorial in real time, docker installation procedures can be found here (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and highly encouraged to be completed beforehand (might mention this description as a prerequisite).
