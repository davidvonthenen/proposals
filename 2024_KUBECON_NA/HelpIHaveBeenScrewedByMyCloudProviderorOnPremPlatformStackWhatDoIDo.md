**Session Title**  
Help I Have Been Screwed By My Cloud Provider or OnPrem Platform Stack: What Do I Do Now?

**Description**  
There has been a lot of news about inflation and rising costs recently. The tech space is not immune to them. These range from being unable to accurately pin down an estimate on your cloud provider bill to increasing prices for On-Prem platform software licenses.

Since Kubernetes acts as an abstraction layer for container workloads, it can be used to migrate from one provider, whether cloud-based or On-Prem, to another. This is a challenging lift and shift because there are considerations like data locality and stickiness, differences in underlying platform behaviors, and virtual network stacks.

This session will identify the challenges and equip you with practical strategies to overcome them, giving you the power to migrate from one solution provider to another. Perhaps the best disaster recovery plan you can have is one that enables you to put money back in your wallet and perhaps even pit two providers against each other to drive down the cost of your bills.

**Additional notes**  
This session is designed to address a critical issue faced by many organizations today: the rising costs and complexities associated with cloud providers and On-Prem platform stacks. The intent is not to criticize any particular solution or provider, but rather to offer practical, positive strategies for navigating these challenges effectively.

The session will focus on real-world scenarios and practical solutions. By highlighting common pain points and offering actionable strategies, attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to manage and potentially reduce their infrastructure costs. Given the current economic climate and ongoing discussions about cost management in tech, this is a timely topic.

The session will maintain a positive outlook, focusing on solutions rather than problems. By providing attendees with concrete steps and strategies, the goal is to empower them to take control of their infrastructure and costs, rather than feeling at the mercy of their providers.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to share these insights and help attendees navigate these challenges effectively.
