**Presentation Title:**  
Creating Voice-Driven AI Subject Matter Experts Using Retrieval Augmented Generation

**Presentation Abstract (max length):**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of how we interact with software and transformed the way we problem-solve, learn, and ultimately do life. Artificial Intelligence has redefined the way we complete the simplest of tasks. Industry leaders understand this is the inflection point for a paradigm shift in how we think and interface with these complex systems.

Case In Point: why did Microsoft make a staggering $13 BILLION investment in OpenAI? The obvious but high-level answer is that AI and machine learning will disrupt everything. While true, the more specific answer is how we search, including web search, will change going forward and Google recognizes this as an existential threat to its search business. This is precisely why when you search for anything on Google today, immediately below your search bar, you have an "AI Overview" answer.

While LLMs are great for answering general-purpose questions, they lack specific details and relevant information for a deeper understanding of a subject. This is where LLMs start to hallucinate. This session will provide a blueprint for creating your own Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These models can then be used to power a multitude of applications, including interactive consultants. This session will provide code recipes for building a Voice-driven Subject Matter Expert using RAG and conclude with a live demonstration.
