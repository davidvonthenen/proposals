**Abstract Title:**  
Microservice Instrumentation and Metrics using Prometheus

**Please provide your abstract:**  
Pop quiz hotshot. You just deployed your microservice into Kubernetes cluster. Customers are complaining that the application is becoming unresponsive or is acting sluggish. What do you do, Jack? What do you do? You can tell the wildcat behind the wheel to simply restart everything, but we all know that is only a temporary fix and you are just kicking the problem down the road.

This session talks about how you can leverage Prometheus in order to give better visibility into and identifying issues using a microservice architecture in Kubernetes. Will provide a live demo of deploying Prometheus, take a look storage driver metrics as an example, and deploy a set of interdependent microservices to see how you can instrument and provide metrics for those services.

**Select the experience level this content is best suited:**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss key tracing concepts and benefits that Prometheus brings to the table. Will provide a live demo of deploying Prometheus, an example set of interdependent microservices, and how you can instrument and provide metrics those services using Prometheus. Attendees will be able to duplicate and use the demo as a starting point for implementation in their own applications and microservices.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None. All demos will be done on Google Compute Engine (GCE).

**Travel Funding:**
