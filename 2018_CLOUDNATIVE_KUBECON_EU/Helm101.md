Helm and Charts: The Easy Button for Deploying Applications

**Please provide your abstract:**  
Deploying containers are easy. Deploying containers with all of the configuration necessary for your application to function, such as service discovery, stateful sets with persistent storage, service accounts, and etc, can be quite difficult. This is where the Open Source project Helm comes into play.

Helm provides an easy and simple way to deploy containers along with all configuration required to run in your Kubernetes environment and also provide the mechanisms to allow for customization. This session will cover the architecture and components required for Helm, Helm chart basics, along with a demo deploying a multi-component microservice based application.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None. All demos will be done on Google Compute Engine (GCE).
