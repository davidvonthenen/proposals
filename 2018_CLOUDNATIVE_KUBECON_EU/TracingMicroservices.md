**Abstract Title:**  
Tracing and Debugging Microservices using Jaeger

**Please provide your abstract:**  
Creating and deploying microservices is easy. The real problem is how to manage and support these services out in the wild and in production. What happens when these services stop working or worse yet when they are running but running slowly? Which service instance is the culprit and how do you identify it?

This session talks about how you can leverage Jaeger in order to give better visibility into the distributed nature of a microservice architecture in a Kubernetes environment. We will walk-through a live demo of deploying Jaeger using Helm and using an example set of interdependent microservices, we will trace those services for debugging and troubleshooting.

**Select the experience level this content is best suited:**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss key tracing concepts and benefits that Jaeger brings to the table. Will provide a live demo of deploying Jaeger using Helm and using an example set of interdependent microservices, we will trace those services for debugging and troubleshooting. Attendees will be able to duplicate and use the demo as a starting point for implementation in their own microservices.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None. All demos will be done on Google Compute Engine (GCE).

**Travel Funding:**  
No
