**Session title**  
Harnessing Conversation Streams: Advanced NLP Techniques

**Description**  
Slack sees 1.5 billion messages each week, Zoom hosts 300 million daily meetings, and Facebook facilitates 260 million conversations on any given day. Such vast data flows turn social platforms into goldmines of insights. This session delves into constructing NLP models to dissect these interactions, pinpointing trends and contextual understanding.

We’ll explore dataset creation, model training, and orchestrating multiple models for robust data mining. We'll also learn how to create NLP models (sentence classification, entity recognition, and more) to process data from diverse audio and video sources to extract metadata and information.

This workshop will provide the foundation for and teach attendees how to create NLP models to be a gateway to mastering conversation data.

**Ideal Talk Format**  
Workshop +1hr

**Talk Track**  
In-Person Workshop

**What you’ll learn?**  
Attendees will learn how to:
1. Harvest information to solve NLP problems
2. How to structure this information to create a dataset
3. Use PyTorch to create multiple Machine Learning models
4. How to apply these generated NLP models to conversation streams (video, audio, and text conversations)

**What is unique about your session?**  
In a sea of ML and AI sessions and workshops, this workshop will stand out by offering something unique: a clear and accessible path for all to embark on their NLP/AI journey. This session is not about high-level concepts; it's about getting hands-on with code and models that attendees can run.

**Workshop Capacity**  
25-30 (could be 50-60 if desired. will need to enlist more resources)

**Workshop prerequisite knowledge**  
Intermediate Python, a Python development environment (will provide setup instructions), Linux Platform Basics (platform of their choice)

**Technical Level**  
3

**Is there anything in this talk you'll be promoting**  
To lower the ramp for technical prerequisites, I will use the Deepgram SaaS platform to aid in the transcription of video and audio and generate human-like audio responses.

The NLP models attendees will generate are independent of ALL platforms. In other words, you could use any Speech-to-Text or Text-to-Speech service or platform. This is simply to lower the barrier of entry for the workshop.
