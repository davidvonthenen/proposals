**Session title**  
Creating Voice-Driven AI Subject Matter Experts Using Retrieval Augmented Generation

**Description**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed how we interact with software and transformed how we problem-solve, learn, and ultimately do life. Artificial Intelligence has redefined the way we complete the simplest of tasks. Industry leaders understand this is the inflection point for a paradigm shift in how we think and interface with these complex systems.

Case In Point: Why did Microsoft make a staggering $13 billion investment in OpenAI? The obvious but high-level answer is that AI and machine learning will disrupt everything. While true, the more specific answer is that how we search, including web search, will change going forward, and Google recognizes this as an existential threat to its search business. This is precisely why when you search for anything on Google today, immediately below your search bar, you have an "AI Overview" answer.

While LLMs are great for answering general-purpose questions, they lack specific details and relevant information for a deeper understanding of a subject. This is where LLMs start to hallucinate. This session will provide a blueprint for creating your own Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These models can then power many applications, including interactive consultants.

This session will provide code recipes for building a Voice-driven Subject Matter Expert using RAG and conclude with a live demonstration.

**What youâ€™ll learn?**  
Attendees will learn:
1. Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Discover the concept of RAG and how it can be used to create more accurate and specialized models.

2. Building Voice-Driven Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): Learn how to build a Voice-driven Subject Matter Expert using RAG, with practical code recipes for implementation.

3. Practical Application and Demonstration: Experience a live demonstration of a Voice-driven SME in action, showcasing how these models can be applied to various real-world applications, such as interactive consultants.

**What is unique about your session?**  
The session doesn't just discuss theoretical concepts; it provides practical, actionable steps for attendees. Participants can immediately apply what they've learned by offering code recipes and live demonstrations. This practical, implementation-focused approach ensures that attendees leave with tangible skills and resources they can use in their own projects.
