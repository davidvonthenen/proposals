David vonThenen is an Open Source Engineer at {code} by Dell EMC. The {code} team lives and breathes Open Source by making contributions to the community in a wide variety of projects ranging from Apache Mesos, Docker, Kubernetes, and storage orchestration platforms. Prior to joining {code} by Dell EMC, David was a technical architect and development lead for a Backup/Recovery solution with a heavy focus in the virtualization space, VMware in particular.

**Abstract Title**  
Easily Enable Persistent Applications using a Software-based Storage Framework

**Abstract. Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal. This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).:**  
Stateless containers are a thing of the past. People today are deploying all sorts of workloads requiring data persistence to Mesos and the number of solutions to achieve data portability is growing. The choice of your backend storage platform may simplify the rollout of your persistent applications or it can become your never-ending worst nightmare.

This talk outlines how combining the power of Mesos Frameworks with the flexibility of Software-based Storage can make the deployment of your persistent applications that much easier and production worthy. A Software-based Storage Framework can dramatically reduce the complexity of having to manage and monitor the storage platform while, at the same time, provide access to your data in a seamless and easy to consume way.

**Audience. Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.:**  
The audience will learn about Software-based Storage Platforms and how they differ from traditional Software Defined Storage. Will discuss deployment, "Day 2" maintenance operations, and the dreaded failure of your platform. Those operational aspects of your storage platform can have significant consequences for your applications. Ultimately, the key takeaway is how to make your applications running in Mesos highly available for production use. A demo will be presented showing how simple it is to deploy a Software-based Storage Platform in the form a Mesos Framework.

**Experience Level. (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any):**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. This could be for Linux, open source, open cloud, embedded, etc.:**  
This presentation will discuss the concept of Software-based Storage and how its deployment onto Mesos, whether it's on bare metal or in cloud environments like AWS, will compliment container schedulers. Those not familiar with Software-based Storage will also be given a high-level introduction to the benefits of the technology.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS.
