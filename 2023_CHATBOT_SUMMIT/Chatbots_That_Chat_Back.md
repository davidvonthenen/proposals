**If you selected a keynote / workshop / moderator please provide an abstract (up to 1000 characters) of your proposed session.:**  
In recent years, chatbot technology has evolved significantly, enabling more interactive and engaging conversations. However, the majority of chatbots still rely on text-based input and output, limiting their potential for seamless and natural interactions. In this session, we will explore the exciting realm of building end-to-end voice-driven chatbots, where users can interact with chatbots using voice or sound as both input and output. We will delve into the technical aspects of speech recognition, natural language understanding, and speech synthesis, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in developing voice-driven chatbots that can understand and respond to users' spoken language with accuracy and fluency. Join us as we unlock the potential of voice-driven chatbots and pave the way for more intuitive and immersive conversational experiences.
