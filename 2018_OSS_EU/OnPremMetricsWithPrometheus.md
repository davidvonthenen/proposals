**Abstract Title:**  
Observability and Metrics in the Cloud and On-Premise using Prometheus

**Abstract:**  
Have you ever wondered how your underlying infrastructure is currently doing? That's a scary question to be asking yourself if you happen to be talking about your production environment. The reality is there are many operations organizations out there that can't definitively answer that question. What happens if you are running your production environment in the public cloud? Should you blindly trust your cloud provider that their services are behaving normally?

Prometheus has the ability to measure and observe the health of your infrastructure whether your compute lives in the public cloud or on-prem in a data center. This session will provide a live demo of how to use Prometheus in a Kubernetes environment to monitor health for both public cloud instances and local on-prem servers and then create alarms and corrective actions when required.

**Audience:**  
The audience will learn about the Prometheus architecture and features that make it well suited to run both in the cloud and on-prem while understanding how these metrics factor into Service Level Agreements (SLAs). These metrics can inherently be used to help remediate issues observed by taking corrective actions to maintain the health of Kubernetes and its applications.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
Prometheus has always had excellent support for metrics collection in the public cloud, but the support for instrumentation for on-premise infrastructure has been met with challenges. This session will highlight recent work done to improve the metrics collection both in the public cloud and for on-prem Kubernetes deployments via a live demo.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE and self-provided vSphere environment.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
