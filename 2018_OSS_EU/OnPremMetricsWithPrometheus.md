**Abstract Title:**  
Kubernetes and Helm: The Easy Button for Deploying Applications

**Abstract:**  
Deploying containers are easy. Deploying containers with all of the configuration necessary for your container to function, such as service discovery, stateful sets with persistent storage, service accounts, and etc, can be quite difficult. This is where the Open Source project Helm comes into play.

Helm provides an easy and simple way to deploy applications along with all configuration required to run in your Kubernetes environment and also provide the mechanisms to allow for customization. This session will cover the architecture and components required for Helm along with a demo deploying a multi-component microservice based application.

**Audience:**  
The audience will learn about the Helm architecture, understand how to navigate the Helm command line interface, get acquainted with the various components of a Helm chart (aka the blueprint for an application deployment), and use the advanced functionality that Helm provides to override configuration options on a given Helm chart.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will enable users to tackle complex Helm deployments as well as give users an introduction to the pieces that make up a Helm chart. That knowledge can then be leveraged in the creation of their own custom Helm charts, learning how to navigate the Kubernetes' chart repository, and possibly make contributions to existing charts.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
