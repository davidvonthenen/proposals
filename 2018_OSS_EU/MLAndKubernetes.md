**Abstract Title:**  
Machine Learning on Kubernetes using Kubeflow

**Abstract:**  
Machine Learning is quickly taking off and providing real benefits to the next generation of applications. How do I go about taking advantage of this new tech? Forget that... how do I go about kicking the tires simply so I can get a better understanding of the benefits that machine learning can provide? That's where Kubeflow comes in!

Kubeflow provides a quick and easy means for standing up a machine learning stack in a Kubernetes environment. It removes the complexity of having to piece together the various components required to leverage the tech and reap the benefits. This session will provide an introduction to machine learning, outline how to stand up Kubeflow and provide an example application to get one started.

**Audience:**  
The audience will receive an introduction into machine learning and walk away with a blueprint on how to stand up an ML stack in a Kubernetes environment. The session will walk through a sample application using Kubeflow to serve as an example of how to leverage all the benefits it has to offer.

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
Machine learning is all the buzz these days and this session will explain what machine learning is in an easy to digest manner and break down the complexity of enabling the use of ML in their applications. This will be achieved through a live demo that will exercise the capabilities of Kubeflow.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over GCE.

**Travel Funding:**  
No
