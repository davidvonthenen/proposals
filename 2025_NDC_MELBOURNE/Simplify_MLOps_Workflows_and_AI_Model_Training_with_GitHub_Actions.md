**Session Title:**  
Simplify MLOps Workflows and AI Model Training with GitHub Actions

**Description:**  
Modern machine learning development demands robust pipelines for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating these workflows, especially when paired with self-hosted runners for high-performance environments. This session will guide you through designing an efficient CI/CD pipeline specifically for MLOps, using open-source tools to manage model training, testing, and deployment.

Weâ€™ll explore how self-hosted runners allow you to leverage GPUs for accelerated ML workloads and integrate with popular open-source projects such as MLflow, Kubernetes, and Docker to create seamless, reproducible pipelines. Expect actionable insights into building scalable workflows that take your ML models from prototype to production, with code samples, resources, and a live demo showcasing a real-world example.
