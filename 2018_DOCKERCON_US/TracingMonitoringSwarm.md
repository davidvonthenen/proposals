**Session Title:**  
Application Monitoring and Tracing in Swarm: Avoiding Microservice Hell!

**Session Abstract:**  
Creating and deploying Microservices is easy. The real problem is how to manage and support these services out in the wild and in production. What happens when these services stop working or worse yet when they are running but running slowly? Which service instance is the culprit? This session talks about how you can leverage Jaeger, OpenTracing, and Prometheus in order to give better visibility into the distributed nature of a Microservice architecture in a Kubernetes environment. Will provide a demo of Microservices leveraging Prometheus and Jaeger deployed to a Swarm cluster.
