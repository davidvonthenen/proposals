**YouTube and other services limit the length of your presentation's description. We will take the first 100 characters of your abstract to display in the YouTube description. Abstract* (max 1000 chars)**  
This session will talk about the current state of OpenStack and discuss various events/actions within the OpenStack community as well as news articles that may shed new light as to OpenStack's future. There has been a dramatic shift in the past year with the adoption rate and companies actively contributing to the project. We are going to sift through the noise and get the real pulse on OpenStack.

**What is the problem or use case youâ€™re addressing in this session?* (max 1000 chars) Characters left: 1000**
The issue about application workloads being tied to the underlying infrastructure is a problem that has been around for quite some time now. Configurations of this nature make your applications sensitive to any issues or failures within your data center. OpenStack is just another manifestation of this problem.

There is a belief in the OpenStack community that free and Open Source solves all problems. The issue is when you don't have the right principles, goals, and vision for the project things go south real fast. The problems that OpenStack solved when it was first introduced aren't problems that need solving today and on top of that, OpenStack brought with it a massive amount of complexity that required people have specialized training and skill sets that are hard to come by.

As OpenStack leads to its inevitable collapse, people whom have deployed OpenStack will need to make strategic decisions on how to migrate to these new platforms like Mesos, Kubernetes, etc.

**What should attendees expect to learn?* (max 1000 chars)**  
Attendees should expect to learn about new strategies on how to insulate themselves from the inevitability of OpenStack going the way of the dodo. They will take home an understand about creating layers of isolation that separate user's workloads in such a way that they are not tied to the underlying infrastructure. Should that legacy infrastructure age to disrepair or lack of support, migration to other workload schedulers will be possible.
