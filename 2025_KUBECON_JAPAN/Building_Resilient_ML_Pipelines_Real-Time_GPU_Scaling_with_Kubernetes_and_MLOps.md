**Session Title**  
Building Resilient ML Pipelines: Real-Time GPU Scaling with Kubernetes and MLOps

**Description**  
MLOps with Kubernetes transforms how we manage AI/ML models, particularly with dynamic scaling capabilities in cloud environments. This session introduces the essentials of MLOps using Kubernetes to automate model deployment and optimize GPU resource utilization. Attendees will learn to configure Kubernetes to recognize GPU constraints in real time, dynamically scaling resources in the cloud to meet peak demand without compromising model performance.

For organizations running on-prem setups, we'll cover leveraging cloud resources for peak demand handling and balancing security with scalability. In a live demonstration, we'll showcase automated scaling, detecting GPU constraints to deploy additional cloud resources seamlessly. Participants will leave with code samples and a clear approach to creating resilient, responsive, cost-effective ML infrastructures for variable workloadsâ€”empowering efficient model scaling across hybrid environments.
