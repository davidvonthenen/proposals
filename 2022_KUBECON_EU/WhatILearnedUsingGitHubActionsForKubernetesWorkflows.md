**Will you be listed as a speaker on this proposal?**  
Yes

**Session Title:**  
Learnings From Creating CI/CD Pipelines for Open Source Kubernetes Projects

**Level of Expertise for Intended Audience:**  
Intermediate

**Which Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosted software will your presentation be focused on?* Check all that apply.**  
Kubernetes, Jaeger, Prometheus, Kube-vip, kind, cluster-api, k3s

**Topic**  
101 (sessions for those new to the conference overall and/or beginners to the conference content, i.e. Kubernetes 101)

**Is your presentation considered a case study?**  
Yes

**Session Description:**  
There are over 20,500 open source projects in GitHub that are tagged by topic as focused on Kubernetes. 92,000+ repositories mention the word Kubernetes in their repository's "About" paragraph signaling some level of integration. How does one of these projects validate that integration at the feature level? or application? What about simply creating releases for consumption?

This session will outline mistakes, successes, and incurred technical debt while implementing a CI/CD process geared towards design verification and a release strategy. This case study will cover the pros and cons and give an in depth analysis on the "why" for decisions made in this project. This serves as a reference for things to consider (and to avoid) while creating Kubernetes-based projects.

Topics covered will include:
- obstacles and limitations on CI/CD design
- extreme code (actually process) reuse
- reproducibility, verification, and automation
- resource and scheduling impacts

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This is a very frank discussion of how my team created an open source Kubernetes project (actually a distribution - https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition) documenting all the triumphs and failures along the way. The focus of this presentation will talk about the various other open source projects in the community used to enable launching our distribution. This talk is not about the distribution itself; rather a timeline of decisions for creating a Kubernetes project relating to CI/CD. This will resonate with other project owners or maintainers but more importantly, be a guide for those looking to start a Kubernetes-focused project of their own.

Specific topics to be covered:
- Self-hosted versus As a Service CI/CD pros and cons
- Technical limitations - runtimes, testbeds, reusability and environment pollution
- Build/release processes and who (or what) purpose they should serve
- Yes, we know automation... but why?
- Strive for perfection? Or maybe just good enough?
