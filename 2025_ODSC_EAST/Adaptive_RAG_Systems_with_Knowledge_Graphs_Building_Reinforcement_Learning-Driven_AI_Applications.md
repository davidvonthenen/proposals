**Presentation Title:**  
Adaptive RAG Systems with Knowledge Graphs: Building Reinforcement-Learning-Driven AI Applications

**Presentation Abstract (max length):**  
This workshop will dive into building an adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using graph databases, designed to continuously improve its performance through reinforcement learning. By combining the rich, interconnected structure of knowledge graphs with a feedback-driven RL loop, this approach enables AI applications that evolve in real-time, leveraging both historical and dynamic insights for smarter, more relevant responses.

This session will focus on how to construct and deploy a knowledge graph-based RAG system that learns from regular feedback. Using open-source graph databases, attendees will gain practical experience in capturing information to used for retraining the model with positive feedback data. This workshop emphasizes the importance of continuous adaptation for production AI applications, teaching participants how to integrate reinforcement signals that fine-tune responses and enhance the overall relevance and accuracy of LLM-powered applications.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will gain a solid understanding of knowledge graphs in RAG applications, including how to build, query, and maintain these systems to support reinforcement learning. Participants will also walk away with practical skills in implementing feedback loops and conducting periodic retraining, enabling them to build adaptive AI solutions capable of meeting evolving data requirements. Ideal for AI developers and data scientists, this workshop will equip attendees with techniques and best practices to deploy high-performance, self-improving AI applications.
