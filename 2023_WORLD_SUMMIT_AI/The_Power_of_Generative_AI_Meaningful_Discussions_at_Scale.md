**Session title:**  
The Power of Generative AI: Meaningful Discussions at Scale

**Abstract:**  
The world has shifted and embraced working remotely. In the post-COVID era, it’s estimated that 27% of US workers are doing so remotely. That’s roughly about one in four people. In this environment, people still need to interact and collaborate with colleagues, customers, and potential clients, most of whom use digital conference platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

This talk focuses on using Conversation and Generative AI to enhance discussions and extract meaningful insights from those digital conversations. We will discuss foundational information relating to both topics, uncover how we can apply them to digital communications, and finally demonstrate what capabilities you can unlock by integrating these platforms.

**Target Audience:**  
Anyone who takes meetings over the internet using services like but not limited to Zoom, Google Meet and who wish to improve their interactions with participants settings that are casual, professional, sales, business, etc

**3 Takeaways:**  
1. Get an introduction to Natural Language Process (NLP), use cases, etc
2. Get an introduction to Generative AI. We are going to take a look at ChatGPT as a model
3. See how combining these two kinds of platforms can act as a force multiplier to enhance conversations

**Tell us a little more about you and your presentation. For example, have there been any papers you have published with details of the area on which you would like to present? How are you unique/different in the way you apply AI or work in the space? Please include any links to you presenting and/or any media coverage.:**  
Since Generative AI is becoming mainstream, there are many opportunities to combine those capabilities in the NLP space. This talk and demo are one of the more interesting ones in which we focus on using sentiment, elaborating on entities, etc., to help guide conversations.
