I have been in Enterprise software for the overwhelming majority of my career (15 years!). Having spanned everything from Storage management both at the initiator/target to backup/recovery solutions both targeting and born in a virtualized environment, I recently got the opportunity to make a paradigm shift to move into the role as a Developer Advocate in the Open Source community. With that change much of how I use to develop a product, heck even product planning, has changed along with it. Some of those changes has been met with challenges and others enabling myself to become both a better developer as well as a contributor in the true sense of the word.

Having been through 2 successful product release in the Open Source community, I highlight 5 significant areas that immediately stand out as going against the norm.

1. Requirements
  - Touch upon requirements in contrast to use-case.
  - Where they both originate from?
  - Why that matters?
2. Development
  - Embrace the use of new technologies to enable software development
  - Empower the developer to contribute
  - Breaking away from tradition and its pitfalls
3. Test
  - Challenges in test and integration. In Open Source many times this is an afterthought.
  - In traditional Enterprise development, there is an advantage since Test is baked into the process.
  - How do we address this?
4. Community
  - Users and the community have a vested interest in the success of your product. Ecosystems!
  - Why APIs don’t create Ecosystems?
5. Open Everything
  - Open Source is a huge change in thinking. Things you couldn’t do before because of Intellectual Property liberates your decisions and actions.
  - Examples… Something as simple as tweeting what I worked on today might not fly in a proprietary product because it might tip your hand on your next feature where in Open Source you might find others doing your marketing for you.
