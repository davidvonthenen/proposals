**Abstract Title**  
How Mesos Can Help With Your Gambling Problem

**Abstract. Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal. This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).:**  
Let's suppose your organization took a pile of modernization money to the race track and bet big on a particular horse because it was touted as being the best, the "latest and greatest", and a sure thing. As the race progresses, you come to find out that others have decided to place bets elsewhere. Some people are even tearing up their bets in frustration because their pony is losing steam due to lack of maintenance. The last thing you want to do is admit we blew the bankroll on a bad investment to your boss... err, your loan shark. What to do?

There are many benefits to Container Schedulers like Mesos. Not only do they enable Cloud Native applications and provide management for containerized workloads, but they also can provide an abstraction layer between your underlying infrastructure and how your application run. There are articles of companies or resources fleeing from technologies all the time with the latest example being Intel by cutting funding to its OpenStack effort in a recent article by Fortune.com. This session will focus on how Mesos can make it easy for your organization to get a divorce from the underlying implementation of your infrastructure and seamlessly transition into Containers or Cloud Native based architecture.

**Audience. Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.:**  
The audience will learn about how they can architect a strategy that not only facilitates their organization to easily replace their underlying infrastructure implementation but also enables a path towards consuming containerized workloads. Will discuss options for moving traditional applications into containers and a process for migrating those applications toward a microservice architecture.

**Experience Level. (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any):**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. This could be for Linux, open source, open cloud, embedded, etc.:**  
Technologies come and go. Some fast than others. This discussion provides decision makers, architects, and operations a blueprint towards modernization of their core business. Since the talk focuses on abstraction layers, the options for what your organization infrastructure and provisioning process remain open based on your needs; whether the best decision is to move on-prem in a datacenter or into the cloud using services like AWS or GCE.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS or with remote infrastructure.
