A Microservices Journey using Jaeger Tracing in Kubernetes

**Please provide your abstract:**  
This talk covers my journey on implementing Jaeger tracing in Microservices running in Kubernetes. We will discuss some of the interesting hurdles and roadblocks that I encountered during implementation. There are a number of interesting considerations that Kubernetes poses due to the way routing and service discovery is handled. These considerations also change between versions of Kubernetes where in certain configurations you may or may not have an optimal implementation.

**Experience Level:**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss how to implement Microservices using Jaeger and OpenTracing to be deployed into a Kubernetes environment. There are a couple of different methods the Jaeger client enables tracing for users. Deploying an application leveraging a Jaeger client into a Kubernetes cluster changes some assumptions about how you might implementing tracing.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None. All demos will be done on Google Compute Engine (GCE).

**Co-presenter:**
