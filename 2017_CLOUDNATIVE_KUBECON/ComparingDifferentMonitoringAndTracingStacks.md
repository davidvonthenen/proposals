A Comparison of Monitoring, Instrumentation and Tracing Stacks

**Please provide your abstract:**  
With the recent adoption of Jaeger as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosted project, this session will focus on providing a compare and contrast between 2 variations of a monitoring and tracing stack. We will focus how substituting Zipkin and Jaeger with OpenTracing and Prometheus provides different benefits and capabilities. Additionally, for those looking to make the leap from your existing Zipkin deployments to Jaeger based one, we will discuss what migration options are available.

Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss two different monitoring and tracing stacks available in the ecosystem. Those not familiar with Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTracing, and Prometheus will get an introduction into the different technology choices that are available and the benefits they provide.
