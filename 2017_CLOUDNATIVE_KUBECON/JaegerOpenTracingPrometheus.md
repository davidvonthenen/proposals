Why You Need to Think About A Monitoring, Instrumentation, and Tracing Stack NOW!

**Please provide your abstract:**  
Everyone talks about Microservices and how they are the wave of the future. There are tons of examples out there on the internet and they look incredibly easy to deploy. Unfortunately, most of those examples never speak to how you are going to manage and support these services in production. What happens when these services stop working or worse yet when they just slow down? Which service instance(s) are the culprit? This session talks about how you can leverage Jaeger, OpenTracing, and Prometheus in order to give better visibility into your distributed nature of a Microservices architecture.

**Experience Level:**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will discuss three key concepts of Instrumentation and Tracing Stack for Kubernetes and highlight Open Source Projects available that address these topics:
1) the value of instrumentation and how Prometheus can be used to monitor and measure Kubernetes and container infrastructure
2) what OpenTracing is and the benefits it provides
3) how Jaeger can provide visibility into your applications and services

Will provide a demo of Microservices leveraging Prometheus and Jaeger deployed to Kubernetes cluster.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None. All demos will be done on Google Compute Engine (GCE).

**Co-presenter:**  
None
