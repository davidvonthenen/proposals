Debugging Microservices at Scale

This presentation will be a hands on demo using Prometheus and Jaeger to debug various scenarios one might encounter in a production deploy of Microservices. We will quickly cover Prometheus and Jaeger and the benefits they provide and then promptly move into the demo. The demo will cover how we can identify potential problems in a Kubernetes cluster by artificially creating issues in the container orchestrator, networking, and deployed Microservices. Audience participation is encouraged to discuss potential root causes for the issues discovered.

**Experience Level:**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem:**  
This presentation will show how to utilize Prometheus and Jaeger to identify issues with Microservices in a Kubernetes environment. Audience participation will be highly encouraged as we will discuss how the various identified problems can translate into things we can check within the environment to resolve the issue. The audience will become familiar with the Prometheus and Jaeger web interfaces and how to navigate various features that they provide.
