**Session title:**  
Enabling Untapped Use Cases in Conversation ML/AI - Edge, Memory-Constrained, and Server-Side

**Session description:**  
Many use cases we see today for utilizing Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence happen in a handful of languages. The prominent ones are Javascript, Python, and Swift/Java (with some Kotlin). Why? Javascript because it naturally integrates with Communication Platforms as a Service. Python because it's foundational in many Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects. Finally, Swift/Java because there are more mobile devices than anything else out there.

How we consume software via APIs in the cloud has revolutionized the dynamics of how developers make software. Yet, how we interact with those APIs is an integral and equally important topic. By that, I'm talking about Software Development Kits (SDK). These represent essential projects that consume APIs and become helpful abstractions that enable developers to build quickly and efficiently.

This talk is about doing or, more specifically, not doing what's expected. It's about doing something different. The focus of this talk is that providing an SDK in an atypical language within a given ecosystem will allow users to build projects and applications in untapped neighboring communities.

**Track:**  
Artifical Intelligence Dev Conference

**2nd Track:**  
IoT Hardware

**Session Format:**  
Technical Session (25mins)

**Can your talk be live, in-person, Feb 15-17, 2023?**  
Yes, in person

**Notes:**  
I will talk about all the foundational software/hardware components that make up projects relating to building edge devices using SDK in AI/ML, Natural Language Processing, and in a memory-constrained environments. I will do this by demo'ing using several open source projects (github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio, github.com/dvonthenen/symbl-go-sdk, github.com/faiface/beep, etc) and as well as several Platform as a Service (GCP, Symbl.ai, etc). The TLDR, I will demo a working open-source digital assistant like Alexa.
