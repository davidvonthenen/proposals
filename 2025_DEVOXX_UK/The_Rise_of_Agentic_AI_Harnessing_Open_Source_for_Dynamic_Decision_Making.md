**Talk Title:** 
The Rise of Agentic AI: Harnessing Open Source for Dynamic Decision-Making

**Talk Abstract:** 
Agentic AI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence—systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and action, far surpassing the passive response mechanisms of traditional models. This talk will explore how to design and build such AI systems using CrewAI, an open-source framework built for crafting modular and scalable agent-based AI systems. Attendees will learn the foundational principles of Agentic AI, from constructing specialized agents to coordinating them to solve complex, real-world problems. We'll discuss how CrewAI's composable architecture integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art AI technologies, transforming theoretical autonomy into practical applications.

To bring these concepts to life, the session will conclude with a live demo showcasing CrewAI in action. We will design and deploy an intelligent fleet of agents collaborating to solve a high-stakes challenge—autonomously managing a simulated smart city under dynamic environmental pressures. This live demonstration will highlight CrewAI's capabilities, leaving attendees inspired and equipped to explore the untapped potential of Agentic AI in their projects.
