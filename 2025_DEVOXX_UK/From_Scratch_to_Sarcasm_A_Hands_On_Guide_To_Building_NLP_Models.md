**Talk Title:**  
From Scratch to Sarcasm: A Hands-On Guide To Building NLP Models

**Talk Abstract:**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the forefront of AI innovation, enabling machines to understand human language better. However, sarcasm—a subtle and often challenging linguistic nuance—frequently eludes traditional sentiment analysis models. In this session, we will demystify NLP by walking attendees through building a sentiment analysis model capable of detecting sarcasm. Using accessible tools and libraries, we'll break the process into clear steps, starting from dataset preparation and feature engineering to model training and evaluation. Along the way, attendees will gain a deep understanding of the principles behind NLP and how to tackle more nuanced challenges.

This session goes beyond theory with a live, step-by-step demonstration. Using open-source software and practical methodologies, we'll build the sarcasm-aware sentiment analysis model from scratch. The live demo will showcase the model in action, highlighting its ability to identify both sentiment and sarcasm in real-time. Attendees will leave the session equipped with a working codebase, actionable techniques, and the confidence to implement similar models in their projects. Whether you're a beginner in NLP or a seasoned practitioner, this talk provides the tools and inspiration to elevate your AI capabilities.
