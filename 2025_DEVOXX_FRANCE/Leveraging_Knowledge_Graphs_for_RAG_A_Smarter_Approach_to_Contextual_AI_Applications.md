**Talk Title:**  
Leveraging Graph Databases for RAG: A Contextual Approach to AI Applications

**Talk Abstract:**  
In the ever-evolving field of AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have become critical for delivering high-quality, contextually relevant answers in large language models (LLMs) applications. While vector databases have traditionally dominated RAG applications, graph databases offer a transformative approach to contextual AI that's often overlooked. This approach provides unique advantages for applications requiring deep insights, intelligent search, and reasoning over structured and unstructured sources, making it ideal for complex business scenarios.

Attendees will leave with an understanding of building a RAG system using a graph database and practical skills for data querying and insights retrieval. By comparing graph and vector database approaches, we'll highlight when and why graph databases may offer superior benefits for managing complex data relationships. The session will provide concrete examples and advanced techniques, empowering participants to incorporate knowledge graphs with LLMs for better data-driven outcomes. This discussion will conclude with a live demo showcasing techniques and insights covered in this talk.
