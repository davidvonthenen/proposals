**Short Abstract:**  
For those workloads or companies where security means everything, pulling container images from public registries are a nonstarter. Because what could possibly go wrong blindly trusting the internet? This session will focus on the advantages and drawbacks of proposed methods for consuming images.

**Long Description:**  
Container registries have made life easy and with the advent of Helm, consuming applications and services have truly simplified managing the lifecycle of containers in Kubernetes. For those workloads or companies where security means everything, pulling container images from public registries are a nonstarter. Because what could possibly go wrong blindly trusting the internet?

This session will discuss options available to secure container images including using Harbor, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project that provides a private container registry. We will look at the advantages and drawbacks of proposed methods for consuming images. A live demo that will include standing up a private registry and how to manage its container images will be provided.
