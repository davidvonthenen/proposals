**Brief Description:**  
Deploying Applications on Kubernetes Can't Get Any Easier

**Short Abstract:**  
Deploying containers with all of the configuration necessary for your container to function, such as service discovery, stateful sets with persistent storage, service accounts, and etc, can be quite difficult. This session will cover Helm's ability to easily deploy applications with all the configuration required to run in a Kubernetes environment and also provide the mechanisms to allow for customization.

**Long Description:**  
Deploying containers are easy. Deploying containers with all of the configuration necessary for your container to function, such as service discovery, stateful sets with persistent storage, service accounts, and etc, can be quite difficult. This is where Helm, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, comes into play.

Helm provides an easy and simple way to deploy applications with all configuration required to run in a Kubernetes environment and also provide the mechanisms to allow for customization. This session will cover the architecture and components required for Helm along with a "how-to" type demo for deploying a multi-component microservice based application.
