# Workshop Using Google Colab

Welcome to landing page for workshop `Building Multiple Natural Language Processing Models to Work In Concert Together` at `2024 Open Data Science Conference West`.

## Prerequisites

Using the Google Colab Notebooks in this workshop is pretty straight forward, but you will need to setup the following **FREE** accounts for services we will be using in this workshop.

## Google Colab

As long as you have a Google account, you should have no problem accessing [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you don't have a Google account, please create one.

### SaaS Platforms

For the last third of the lab, we are going to make use of the following SaaS platforms:

- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) - This is to help facilitate building an Voice-Activated AI Assistant/Agent.
