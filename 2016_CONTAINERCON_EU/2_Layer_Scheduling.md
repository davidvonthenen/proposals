**Abstract Title**  
How 2 Layer Scheduling is Changing the World

**Abstract. Provide an abstract that briefly summarizes your proposal. This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).:**  
Persistent applications that can be complex to operate and scale tend to be perfect for modern schedulers such as Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, and etc. Internal direct attached storage and external storage are both options to run your applications. This talk outlines how 2 layer scheduling enables deployment of managed frameworks and tasks, while maintaining fault tolerance and scalability.

**Audience. Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.:**  
The audience will learn about a critical principle concept in container schedulers. Many container schedulers already have this present in their Ecosystem while other container schedulers have the feature as prior number one in their roadmaps. 2 Layer Scheduling will fundamentally change the way we consume container runtimes, like Docker, Rocket, and etc.

**Experience Level. (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any):**  
Intermediate

**Benefits to the Ecosystem. Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. This could be for Linux, open source, open cloud, embedded, etc.:**  
This presentation will introduce the concept of 2 Layer Scheduling in many different scheduling platforms (Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Swarm, and etc) in which we will do a compare and contrast between those schedulers. Those not familiar with container schedulers will also be introduced to the available offerings in the Ecosystem.

**Technical Requirements:**  
None, all demos will be done over AWS.
